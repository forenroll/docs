I see. Thanks.
Is there any document shows the subgroups and the order in which these subgroups should be displayed.

And there's one more thing.
It is shown in "RHCI Matrix.xlsx" that the combinatin as RHELOSP 4.0 and RHEV 3.2 is imcompatible, however, information regarding what functionality is supported between the two products is not provided.
Will the matrix be updated or it means that none of the functionality between them is supported?
